- install version 22 of OpenJDK
- install latest version of Intellij Community Edition
- create a new private github repository and name it last-second
- use spring initializer to create a new Spring Boot project: https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.3.3&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=22&groupId=com.bagdouri&artifactId=lastsecond&name=lastsecond&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.bagdouri.lastsecond&dependencies=lombok,configuration-processor,devtools,web
- extract the spring project into your local github repository
- build the project using maven

- create a model class representing a flight booking: 
id, customer first name, customer last name, customer ID number, departure airport, departure date/time, arrival airport, arrival date/time, price
- create a service FlightBookingService that manages flight bookings:
--> create flight booking (save in a list or map for now)
--> get flight booking by ID
--> get all flight bookings
--> update flight booking
--> delete flight booking

- create a controller FlightBookingController that provides endpoints to manage flight bookings.

- add the springdoc dependency to your maven POM file to generate an OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
            <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui</artifactId>
            <version>2.6.0</version>
        </dependency>
		
- run the application on your local environment:
--> make sure that the application starts successfully
--> make sure that the swagger is accessible on https://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
--> make sure that all of your endpoints work as expected
- commit and push your code to github
